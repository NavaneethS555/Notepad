# Notepad

Notepad is an application developed by Microsoft. We can write, edit, save the text documents in Notepad.

I have implemented an application similar to Notepad in Java using Eclipse IDE. I have used the object oriented concepts like classes, objects, implements, constructors, 'this' keyword, etc.

It performs basic operations like creating new files, opening existing files,saving the file, doing undo and redo of the text, changing font size and background color.
